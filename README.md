# Code Quiz

This project put into practice JavaScript as well as a bit of html and getting the two to communicate with each other. I also worked with making a timer work and getting buttons to work.

## Getting Started

As you open this file you will see instructions about starting a coding quiz. As you select answers to the questions you will recieve a time penalty if your answer is incorrect.

### Prerequisites

A laptop or PC.

## Running the tests
I found this project quite challenging, and it revealed to me some of the holes in my knowledge about javascript. I hope to contiue learning and experimenting as I continue through this class. I apologize for the broken code. I could not figure it out by the deadline.



## Built With
